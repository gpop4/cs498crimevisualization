  <h1 style="text-align: center;">United States Violent Crime Visualization</h1>

  <div class="item">
  <p style="font-size: 22px"> Have you ever wondered about violent crime statistics in United States? What categories of violent crime exists in the United States? Which categories of crime are prominent in each state? Despite United States being a world superpower and the richest nation measured by GDP, it is still plagued by violent crime in all the 50 states. I was able to obtain the crime statistics from uniform crime reporting statistics website and visualize the crime data to get answers to the questions. </p>
